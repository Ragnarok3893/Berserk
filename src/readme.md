 in a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kentaro Miura. Set in a medieval Europe-inspired dark fantasy world,
  the story centers on the characters of Guts, a lone swordsman, and Griffith, the leader of a mercenary band called the "Band of the Hawk". 
  Miura premiered a prototype of Berserk in 1988. 
  The series began the following year in the Hakusensha's now-defunct magazine Monthly Animal 
  House, which was replaced in 1992 by the semimonthly magazine Young Animal,
   where Berserk has continued its publication.
   Following Miura's death in May 2021, the final chapter that he wrote and illustrated was 
   published posthumously in September of the same year; the series resumed in June 2022, 
   under supervision of Miura's fellow manga artist and childhood friend Kouji Mori [ja] and Miura's group of assistants and apprentices from Studio Gaga.
